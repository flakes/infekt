  * Added some command line arguments to main iNFEKT program (try --help) - issue 74
  * Got rid of all CUDA/NViDiA specific code and files
  * Made the blur effect use C++ AMP - also supports ATI hardware now, but only on Windows Vista, 7 and 8
  * Status of GPU acceleration (used yes/no) is now shown in About dialog (F1)
  * Needs Visual C++ 2012 runtime DLLs (previously 2010), installer will download if necessary, shipped with portable versions
